error[E0605]: non-primitive cast: `&'static str` as `Arc<str>`
  --> $DIR/non-primitive-cast-135412.rs:8:13

LL |     let _ = "String" as Arc<str>;
   |             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ an `as` expression can only be used to convert between primitive types or to coerce to a specific trait object
   |
help: consider using the `From` trait instead
   |
LL -     let _ = "String" as Arc<str>;
LL +     let _ = Arc::<str>::from("String");
