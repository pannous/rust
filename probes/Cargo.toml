# This is a test-only crate for custom Rust syntax extensions
# Tests should be run with ./run_all_tests.sh using the custom rustc

#[lib]
#path = "lib.rs"
#test = false

# Auto-discover test files with .rust extension in tests/ directory
# Cargo normally only looks for .rs files, so we need to explicitly list them
# or use a build script to generate test entries
