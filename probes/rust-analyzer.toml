# Note: Files in this directory use custom Rust syntax extensions
# They must be run with the custom rustc via ./run_all_tests.sh
# IDE support is limited but provides basic navigation and structure

#[diagnostics]
# Disable some diagnostics since we use custom syntax
#disabled = ["syntax-error", "unresolved-macro-call"]

#[check]
## Don't run cargo check automatically (it will fail with custom syntax)
